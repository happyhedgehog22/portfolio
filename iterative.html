            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This project was done for CS1300: UI/UX. The goal of the assignment was to design an interface for an existing startup without looking at the startup’s current UI. We went through several rounds of design and feedback to ensure we had the best design.  </p>
            <p>The startup we chose was Fetii. A company that uses large passenger vans and buses to transport large groups of people. Similarly to Uber, users can book rides for now or later depending on their needs, but instead of one person paying with Fetii it is much easier to split the bill. Users can scan a QR code before getting on a vehicle to split the ride fare. Fetii targets a large consumer group ranging from corporate groups attending conferences to greek life groups. In this project, we designed a new desktop website for Fetii where users can book rides, find out about the company, and apply to work as a driver for Fetii.</p>

                <h3>Sketching</h3>
                <p>We began by coming up with four different designs for the website based on the company description found on Ycombinator.</p>
                <p>For all the designs below you can click on the left or right of the images of all the sketches to scroll through the different pages sketched out</p>

                    <p>The first design idea we explored was one with a side nav bar instead of a traditional top nav bar. This design had a video on the home page and an option to reserve a ride or schedule one for the future. We also included sketches for the pages to apply for a job and request a ride.</p>

                <p>Based on our sketches, we made wireframes based on the following design decisions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature both Rider and Driver functionality. Need a clear and distinct navbar that shows the user where they currently are on the page.</li>
                    <li>Ordering a van should have a minimalist design and highlight the key items: pickup/dropoff location and time and a map for the user to visualize the route</li>
                    <li>Pickup Now and Pickup Later should look very similar, the user should understand what to do either way</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>"Request a Ride” page was unclear:</b> In general, users wanted a clearer and more intuitive experience, as well as more information about the ride. Specifically, users found it unclear how to set a location, pay for the ride, specify the number of riders, and did not find an estimated price.
                        <ul>
                            <li>To fix this we added a place for users to enter the number of passengers and estimated cost on the initial ride request page</li>

            <h2>Step 3: Usertesting</h2>
            <p>Usertesting is a platform where users can test out prototypes and designers can get feedback in the earlier stages to make adjustments to their products</p>


            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Tasks</h3>
                <p>These were the tasks that our testers were given.</p>
                <p>Scenario: Imagine that you need to transport yourself and a group of others. Book a ride for the group. This platform is a prototype so some elements may be prefilled and not able to be interacted with.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website?</li>
                    <li>Book a ride for now</li>
                    <li>Submit a job application on this website</li>
                    <li>Set up an account on this website</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After each task, the user was asked two questions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Did you complete the task successfully?</li>
                    <li>Rate this task overall from very difficult to very easy</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Usertesting Feedback</h3>
                <p>Here is a summary of the feedback we received from the three users who tested our prototype</p>
                <h4>Initial impressions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most prominent features: the color purple, the name of the company, the request a ride button, the sign up to drive button, and the nav bar </li>
                    <li>Appears to have everything they would expect from a rideshare company</li>
                    <li>One user mentioned items in the nav bar are not level</li>
                    <li>One user mentioned that they thought the my account button should be an icon</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Book a ride for now</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 out of 3 users were able to complete the task with little to no difficulty</li>
                    <li>One user never hit confirm</li>
                    <li>One user mentioned they would like to see the estimated pick up time before the confirmation screen</li>
                    <li>All noticed you could navigate via the nav bar or the home screen</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Submit an application</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All users were able to easily complete the task</li>
                    <li>One user mentioned the photo on the confirmation page was not inclusive</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Set up an account</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All three users were able to complete the task easily</li>
                    <li>One user questioned whether past drives would expand to scroll on the page or link to another page</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Future Changes</h3>
                <p>Based on the feedback received in Usertesting these are changes we will implement in the future</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the nav bar smaller and have all nav bar contents level within</li>
                    <li>Show the estimated pick up time before the user needs to confirm the ride</li>
                    <li>Change photo on confirmation of application screen to be more diverse and inclusive</li>
                    <li>Create a past drives page</li>
                </ul>
            </div>   
        </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of reworking design and seeking outside feedback. Even after improving our design based on feedback from the critique we still found a number of issues from our Usertesting research.</p>
